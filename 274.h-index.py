    #  * Testcase Example:  '[3,0,6,1,5]'
    #  *
    #  * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
    #  * citations a researcher received for their i^th paper, return compute the
    #  * researcher's h-index.
    #  * 
    #  * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an
    #  * index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other
    #  * n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
    #  * 
    #  * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the
    #  * h-index.
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * Example 1:
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    #  * Output: 3
    #  * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each
    #  * of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
    #  * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the
    #  * remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * Example 2:
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * Input: citations = [1,3,1]
    #  * Output: 1
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * Constraints:
    #  * 
    #  * 
    #  * n == citations.length
    #  * 1 <= n <= 5000
    #  * 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
    #  * 
    #  *
