 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,3]\n[3,4,5,6]\n[50,10,40,70]'
 *
 * We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to
 * endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].
 * 
 * You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum
 * profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with
 * overlapping time range.
 * 
 * If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another
 * job that starts at time X.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
 * Output: 120
 * Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
 * Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * ‚Å†
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit =
 * [20,20,100,70,60]
 * Output: 150
 * Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
 * Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
 * Output: 6
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9
 * 1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4
 *
